# github-action-test
23.5.2024: testing github actions. Started at [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions),
  and I don't know where I have clicked to be misled.
  Trying to re-do, I must say that as well [Overview]() as [Quicktart]() seem to work pretty well.

  After some frustrating oddysee during which I 
* created repo [`github-action-test`](/)
* created a non-working [.github/workflows/main.yml]() [TO DO: explain "non working"]
* created a branch in order to create a `v1` tag [currently still don't know whether this is needed]
* ...

  I finally found
* [Quickstart for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart) worked like a charm:
  * created  
So far:
* 
* First I tried to follow the instructions at ...
  * the "composite action" I started didn't work.
  *  ...
  *  .github/workflows/main.yml
  *  didn't work : explain why
